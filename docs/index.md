## Hi â€” I'm Katie ðŸ‘‹

I am an undergraduate student at Southern Methodist University studying Computer Science and Creative ComputationI build playful, interactive web experiences that showcase creative coding, visualization, and front-end engineering. This portfolio highlights a small selection of my projects and work.


### About this project

This repository was originally created for the CRCP-3320 final assignment but has been adapted into a personal portfolio. I plan on using this web app to show of my skills and works in a fun and dynamic way.
