## Hi â€” I'm Katie ðŸ‘‹

I am an undergraduate student at Southern Methodist University studying Computer Science and Creative ComputationI build playful, interactive web experiences that showcase creative coding, visualization, and front-end engineering. This portfolio highlights a small selection of projects, sketches, and utilities that demonstrate JavaScript, animation, and UX-first thinking.


### About this project

This repository was originally created for the CRCP-3320 final assignment but has been adapted into a personal portfolio. It focuses on lightweight, static delivery and easy-to-read code so anyone can fork and explore the examples.
